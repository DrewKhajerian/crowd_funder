# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# Destroy all pre-existing data before seeding

# User.destroy_all
# Project.destroy_all

# user = User.create!(first_name: "King", last_name: "Buzzo", email: "king@buzzo.com", password: "foobar")

# project4 = user.projects.create!(title: "Project 10", teaser: "Teaser text 10",
#   description: "Description 10", goal: 10000)

# project5 = user.projects.create!(title: "Project 11", teaser: "Teaser text 11",
#   description: "Description 11", goal: 180000)

# project6 = user.projects.create!(title: "Project 12", teaser: "Teaser text 12",
#   description: "Description 12", goal: 50000)
